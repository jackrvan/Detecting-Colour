Final project for 60-499 at the University of Windsor.

K-Means algorithm to segment an image into similar pixels.

Implemented as a Desktop Application using Java and Swing for GUI. Also implemented as an Android Application as another repository.

After segmentation you can click on the boxes and change the colour of all pixels assigned to that colour.
